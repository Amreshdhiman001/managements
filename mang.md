## Define Clear Issue Categories

Clearly define and document different categories of issues relevant to your project or organization. 
This helps in organizing and prioritizing problems effectively.

## Create a Centralized Issue Tracking System

Implement a centralized issue tracking system, such as Jira, Trello, or GitHub Issues. A centralized
system provides a single source of truth, making it easier to manage and track issues across the organization.

## Establish a Clear Workflow

Define a well-documented and standardized workflow for issue management. This should include stages from
issue identification to resolution. Ensure that team members understand and follow the established workflow.

## Prioritize and Categorize Issues

Assign priorities to each issue based on its severity and impact on the project. Categorize issues to
streamline the resolution process. Use labels or tags to quickly identify the nature of the problem.

## Assign Ownership

Assign clear ownership of each issue to a responsible team member. This ensures accountability and
prevents issues from falling through the cracks.
